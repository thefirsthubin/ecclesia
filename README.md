# Ecclesia — Church Operating System

Nx monorepo implementing the system specified in the **Ecclesia PRD (v1.0)**
and the **Ecclesia Technical Blueprint / PTB v2.0 (v1.0)**. Those two
documents, plus the **PRD Open Questions Resolution Workshop**, are the only
source of truth for product and architectural decisions; this repository
implements them and must not silently diverge from them. If code and
documentation disagree, that is a bug in one of the two — raise it, don't
pick a side quietly.

## Current status

**Sprint 0 — Engineering Foundation: complete.** All 14 Nx projects (`api`,
`worker`, `mobile`, `web-admin`, and ten shared libraries) are registered,
build, lint, and test cleanly from a fresh install. No business logic,
database models, authentication, or UI exist yet — this sprint was
tooling only.

**Sprint 1.0 — Repository Protection: complete.** A GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm install` / `lint` /
`test` / `build` against a clean checkout on every push and pull request —
the same gate above, automated, so a regression is caught by CI rather
than discovered later by hand.

**Sprint 1.1 — RBAC executable specification: complete.** `libs/rbac` now
holds the PRD §17.3 permission matrix as executable data, the record-level
policy checks (BR-STW-04, the Poimen gate), the authorization engine, and
the NestJS guards/decorator that will apply it once controllers exist.
See `libs/rbac/README.md`. Not wired into `apps/api` yet — that happens
alongside the People domain's first real controllers.

**Sprint 1.2 — NestJS platform foundation: complete.** `apps/api/src/platform`
now provides Zod-validated process config, structured logging
(`nestjs-pino`), a version-neutral `/health` endpoint (`@nestjs/terminus`),
a per-route Zod validation pipe, Swagger at `/docs`, and a workspace-wide
exception filter that logs denials at `warn` and bugs at `error` (Security
by Default). URI path versioning (`/v1/...`) is enabled from this first
endpoint, per Blueprint §14.7. See `apps/api/README.md`. `libs/rbac` is
still not wired in — that's the RBAC guards' first real usage, alongside
Sprint 1.4 authentication and the People domain's first controllers.

**Sprint 1.3 — Database Foundation: DRAFT, not yet verified.** `db/`
holds a Prisma schema and hand-written initial migration covering the
seven bounded-context Postgres schemas, Row-Level Security policies, the
append-only Financial Transaction event log, and the temporal
GroupMembership model (Blueprint §7.2-§7.5, per `db/migrations/README.md`'s
existing commitment) — designed **without** the actual Blueprint §7.2-7.5
text, at the user's explicit direction, from evidence already committed
in `libs/rbac` and every domain library's README. See `db/DESIGN_NOTES.md`
for the full traceability index and open questions before trusting any of
it. `apps/api/src/platform/database` wires a `PrismaService` and a
database health indicator. Unlike every sprint above, this one has not
been confirmed against a real PostgreSQL instance or the real Prisma
CLI — no database or package registry access was available while building
it. Do not build on this schema until it has been reviewed against the
actual Blueprint and applied successfully to a real database.

Next: Sprint 1.4 (Cognito authentication) — before the first business
domain (People) is implemented, per Blueprint §15.4. Sprint 1.3's open
questions should be resolved before or alongside People, since that
domain's controllers are the schema's first real consumer.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22.x (see `.nvmrc`) | Runtime |
| pnpm | ≥ 9.0 (via Corepack) | Package manager (Blueprint ADR-002) |

```bash
# Enable Corepack and pin the pnpm version declared in package.json
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate
```

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install       # installs dependencies and runs `prepare` (Husky hooks)
npx nx show projects
pnpm lint          # nx run-many --target=lint --all
pnpm test          # nx run-many --target=test --all
pnpm build         # nx run-many --target=build --all
pnpm format:check  # prettier --check .
```

All five commands above must pass before a change is considered done —
this is enforced automatically on every push and pull request by
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Repository layout

This layout mirrors Blueprint Chapter 2, §6.2 exactly — each directory's
own `README.md` states its purpose, which PRD/Blueprint section it
implements, and which future milestone populates it.

```
apps/
  api/          NestJS modular monolith (Blueprint ADR-001)
  worker/       Background worker: Church Pulse, notifications, sweeps
  mobile/       React Native (Shepherds, Basonta Leaders, Treasurers, Members)
  web-admin/    React (Resident Pastor, Assistant Pastors, Admins)
libs/
  domain/       Framework-agnostic business logic, one lib per bounded context
    people/
    pastoral-care/
    ministry/
    gatherings/
    stewardship/
    insights/
  contracts/    Shared DTOs / Zod schemas (Blueprint §6.3)
  rbac/         Permission matrix as code + guard primitives (Blueprint §9.3-9.4)
  config/       Typed configuration loading (Blueprint §6.2)
  testing/      Shared fixtures/factories (Blueprint §14.2)
infra/          AWS CDK (Blueprint Ch.5)
db/
  migrations/   Prisma migration history (Blueprint §7.6)
```

## Module boundaries

`eslint.config.cjs` enforces the dependency-direction rules from Blueprint
§4.3 and §5.2 via `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`: a domain library may
depend only on `libs/contracts`, never on another domain library or on
`libs/rbac` directly; applications may depend on anything. This is checked
in CI on every pull request, not left to code-review discipline alone.

## Commit conventions

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
enforced by Commitlint (`commitlint.config.js`) via the `commit-msg` Husky
hook. Scopes are restricted to the module/app inventory above plus a small
set of infrastructure scopes (`ci`, `deps`, `repo`, `infra`, `db`) — see
`commitlint.config.js` for the exact list. Example:

```
feat(stewardship): enforce same-actor check on transaction verification

Implements FR-STW-03, BR-STW-04 (PRD §13.5, §15.5): a Treasurer may not
verify a transaction they personally recorded.
```
