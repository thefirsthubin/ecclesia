/**
 * PRD §12.8's Church Pulse weighted-scoring model: a stream of typed
 * Engagement Signals, reduced to a per-category sub-score, then combined
 * via configurable weights into one composite 0-100 score.
 *
 * **The six signal categories are `[PRD-DERIVED]`, not `[BLUEPRINT-EXACT]`.**
 * §12.8's own flowchart names six *signal source* boxes (Attendance
 * Records, Group Membership changes, Financial Transactions, Follow-up
 * task outcomes, Role Assignments, Visitor-to-Member conversions); §8.1
 * separately names six *scoring* categories (attendance consistency,
 * Bacenta participation, serving activity, follow-up responsiveness,
 * leadership engagement, visitor retention) that do not map 1:1 onto the
 * flowchart's six boxes (e.g. "leadership engagement" and "serving
 * activity" both plausibly derive from the same Role Assignment signal
 * source; "Financial Transactions" is a signal source with no
 * identically-named §8.1 scoring category). This module treats the
 * flowchart's six *signal source* types as the computational unit - one
 * weight per source type - since that is what the `EngagementSignal`
 * entity itself is typed by (`signalType`), and flags this narrative
 * inconsistency rather than silently resolving it with an invented
 * mapping table.
